# Credible-mathematical-model-of-the-cardiovascular-system-response-to-fluid-perturbation
This software code provides a mathematical model of the cardiovascular system (CVS) response to fluid perturbation, developed and validated using data collected from animal (sheep and swine) subjects. The model is built in MATLAB Simulink environment and the goal is to generate a cohort of simulated subjects against a test subject. The simulated subjects lead to a prediction envelope, which is used to evaluate predictive capability performance of the mathematical model and show its ability to generate valid virtual CVS physiological responses to fluid perturbation for the future non-clinical simulated testing setups. These testing setups may be useful as part of assessing physiological closed-loop control algorithms for automated fluid resuscitation systems. The CVS mathematical model is a low-order lumped parameter model, designed for use with virtual cohort generation tools. It takes rates of hemorrhage, urine, and fluid infusion as inputs and produces outputs for hematocrit (HCT), blood volume (BV), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and mean arterial blood pressure (BP). The mathematical model calibration is defined based on the maximum likelihood estimation of its parameters. A compartment-based virtual cohort generation tool described in [1,2] is used to simulate virtual subjects and generate a prediction envelope used for model predictive capability performance. For more information about the animal study please refer to [3].
